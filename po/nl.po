#. ##
#. Forces the component to emit a 'display' signal
#. for the current widget (and causes the build method
#. to be executed if no widget has been displayed yet).
#. Change the component's visibility flag.  This doesn't
#. actually make the component visible or invisible: instead,
#. it tells the component whether or not it is currently being
#. viewed.  If a component is hidden, we often want to do things
#. like "freeze" views so that they don't respond to rcd changes.
#. Ask the window embedding this component to switch to another
#. component.
#. Ask the window embedding this component to push the current
#. component (i.e. ourselves) onto the component stack and to switch
#. to another component.
#. Ask the window embedding this component to pop a component off of
#. the stack and switch to it.  If the stack is empty, this is a no-op.
#. Send a status message to the window embedding this component.  The
#. window is expected to do something reasonable with the message, like
#. displaying it in a status bar.
#. Pop the component's previous message off of the status bar.
#. Signal our 'busy state' to the window embedding this component.
#. When we tell the window we are busy (i.e. set the busy flag to
#. 1), it should give some user feedback (i.e. throbbing a throbber
#. or pulsing a progress bar) until we transmit a busy flag of 0.
#. Pass a widget up to the window embedding this component.  This widget
#. becomes the "view" on the component, replacing any previous widget.
#. Proxy selected signals from package views
#. Proxy busy and message signals from arrays.
#. ##
#. ## Virtual functions
#. ##
#. This should always be the same as the long name plus a menu mnemonic
#. Always autoresize our connected views, since the treeview is
#. stupid and doesn't work properly if the widget is hidden.
#. ##
#. ## Hints for setting up component navigation
#. ##
#. ##
#. ## A convenience class that handles all of the signal connecting and
#. ## disconnecting required to monitor a component.
#. ##
#. A paranoid check: make sure that a component matches what the
#. ComponentListener thinks is the current component.
