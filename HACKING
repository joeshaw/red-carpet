CONTRIBUTING
------------

Contributions to Red Carpet are more than welcome.  Red Carpet is
written in Python and C.  It uses Gtk+ 2.0 and pygtk, the Python
Gtk+ bindings.

Discussion takes place on the rc-devel@lists.ximian.com mailing list.
Patches should be sent there, and should follow the existing stylistic
conventions, be accompanied by a ChangeLog entry, and sent in GNU
unified diff format (diff -u).

Please DO NOT commit to CVS without approval from one of the
maintainers.
