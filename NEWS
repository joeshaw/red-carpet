Red Carpet 2.0.3
----------------
5 September 2003

	* Require pygtk 2.0.0

	* Don't crash when we get an invalid channel icon, just show the
	  default channel icon.  (Requires an upgrade to newer pygtk)

	* Check the new protocol version, to make migration to rcd 2.0
	  a little less hairy.

	* Replaced deprecated calls that would throw warnings with pygtk
	  2.0.0.

Red Carpet 2.0.2
----------------
8 July 2003

	* Fix a bug where the channel option box selection said
	  "All channels" but it was only searching subscribed channels
	  by default.

	* Refresh the channel data after a successful RCX/RCE activation.
	  (#43740)

	* Refresh the channel data after the host has been changed. (#43740).

	* Poll using a timeout, not an idle handler, so we're not polling
	  the daemon several times a second. (#42931)

	* When changing the sorting in a package list, keep the selection
	  of the items themselves, and not the place in the list where they
	  were previously. (#43543)

	* Show the proper abbreviations for kB and MB. (#42283)

	* Limit many of the exceptions that will cause the "dead daemon"
	  dialog to pop up, in the hopes that it will help make bugs more
	  apparent.

	* Add Select All/Select None to most of the package views. (#43231)

	* When mousing over items in the menubar, show a description of the
	  action in the statusbar.  (#43231)

	* Use GtkSettings to listen for changes in the toolbar style and
	  icon sizes.  (#43231)

	* Add a progress bar for the total progress of the transaction.
	  (#40419)

	* Change "Connect..." to "Connect to daemon..." to be more clear.
	  (#40205)

Red Carpet 2.0.1
----------------
22 May 2003

	* Fixed a problem where invoking help on some systems would cause
	  Red Carpet to hang until after help was exited. (#43144)

	* Included Docbook XSL so we can transform the XML into HTML
	  so we can display help on non-GNOME 2-based desktops. (#42605)

	* Fixed a number of HIG-related problems. (most of #43231, #42703)

	* Improved error messages when RCX/RCE activation fails. (#43331)

	* Fixed a potential display problem when presenting licenses for
	  packages which require license agreement.
