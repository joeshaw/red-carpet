	* Fixed a problem where invoking help on some systems would cause
	  Red Carpet to hang until after help was exited. (#43144)

	* Included Docbook XSL so we can transform the XML into HTML
	  so we can display help on non-GNOME 2-based desktops. (#42605)

	* Improved error messages when RCX/RCE activation fails. (#43331)
