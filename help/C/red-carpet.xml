    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
       <application>Ximian Red Carpet</application> is a program designed to
       help you manage the software you have on your computer. It can
       help you install, update, and remove programs, without making you keep
       track of dependencies and conflicts yourself.  It works with
       the package management structures your operating systems
       already has, so you can use it alongside command-line tools
       without running into conflicts.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Red Carpet 2 has a number of important differences from the
      previous version.  The appearance and interface have been
      completely overhauled, and there are several new features,
      such as the ability to manage software on remote systems, and 
      the queue of pending actions which lets you choose
      installations, removals, and upgrades of software in 
      multiple channels, then do everything at once.
    </para>

    <para>
      One key difference is that, as of Red Carpet 2.0, Red Carpet the
      graphical tool is actually a client for
      <application>rcd</application>, the Red Carpet Daemon.
      Having two pieces means that you can update remote systems
      running the daemon. It also allows the use of alternate clients 
      like the <application>rc</application> command line software
      management tool. Detailed information about
      <application>rc</application> and <application>rcd</application>
      are available in their man pages (standard manuals). You
      can read them by typing <userinput>man rc</userinput> or
      <userinput>man rcd</userinput> at the command line.
    </para>

    <note id="whats-a-package">
      <title>What is a Package?</title>
      <para>
        Software for most versions of Linux is shipped as a
        <emphasis>package</emphasis> file, most commonly the 
        <systemitem>rpm</systemitem> or <systemitem>deb</systemitem>
        format. Each package contains a set of files that constitute
        the software itself, plus additional information about what
        the software is, what requirements it has, and where it should
        be installed.  Proper packaging makes software easier to
        install, upgrade, or remove, and can help manage the
        interdependencies among various programs.
      </para>

      <para>
        Ximian Red Carpet supports the <systemitem>rpm</systemitem>
        (Red Hat Package Manager, used by many distributions), and the
        <systemitem>deb</systemitem> (Debian) package formats.
      </para>

    </note>

    <para>
       <application>Ximian Red Carpet</application> also gives you
       access to two important services from Ximian, Inc.  The first
       service, Red Carpet Express, is for individuals, and offers
       access to special high-speed servers with faster connections,
       so you get better download rates.  The other service, Ximian
       CorporateConnect, is aimed at businesses and workgroups that
       want to manage software deployment on a relatively large scale.

            The <application>Ximian Red Carpet</application> update

              Ximian ships software for a limited number of operating
              systems. Not all software is available for all systems,
              although Ximian Red Carpet typically supports the
              broadest range of systems.  The official list

    <title>Channels</title>
  <para>
    Ximian Red Carpet organizes software into channels, groups of
    software sorted by origin or topic.  "Red Hat 8.0," "Ximian
    Evolution Beta Snapshots," and "Ximian Desktop" are all channels.
    You can subscribe to different channels based on your interest in
    them. Software from channels to which you are not subscribed is
    not updated or installed.
  </para>

    To subscribe to a channel, select    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Channel Subscriptions</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice> or press the <guibutton>Channels</guibutton> button
    in the toolbar. A window will open to show you the list of
    available channels. Check the box next to a channel to subscribe.
  </para>

  </sect1>


  <sect1 id="rc-update">
    <title>Update</title>
    <para>
      When you start Ximian Red Carpet it will show you a list of
      software packages that you can update. An update notice is only
      shown for software that you already have installed, that is in a
      channel to which you are subscribed, and for which there is a
      newer version than what you already have. New software, and new
      versions of software that you have but that is in a channel to
      which you do not subscribe, is not part of the update screen.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      If you do not see any updates, make sure that you are subscribed
      to the right channels. See <xref linkend="rc-channels" /> to learn
      how to adjust channel subscriptions.

                   version. However, it is possible to "repackage" it,
                   creating an archived version so you can switch back 
                   if necessary.  Repackaging is time consuming and
                   uses significant amounts of disk space.
