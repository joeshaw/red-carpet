	* red_packagebrowser.py (PackageBrowser.show_popup_cb): Use the
	extra time and button number arguments when popping up the menu.

	* red_packageview.py (PackageView.button_clicked_for_popup_cb):
	Propagate the event button number and time through the chain of
	callbacks and idle functions, since the GdkEvent itself seems to
	get mangled by the time we actually need this info to pop up our
	menu.  This fixes the weird problem (due to a bad event time)
	where the pop-up menu would disappear unless button 3 was held
	down
	(PackageView.do_popup): Support the extra arguments discussed
	above.
	

	* Makefile.am (red_carpetsupport_DATA): Updated the list of files
	so that we can make distcheck.
