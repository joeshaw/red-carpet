Ximian Red Carpet is a graphical interface to the Red Carpet Daemon (rcd).

ABOUT RED CARPET
----------------
To use Red Carpet, you will also need the Red Carpet Daemon (rcd),
available in the "rcd" module in GNOME CVS (and probably from wherever
you got this package).

Red Carpet uses XML-RPC, either over unix domain sockets (for local
connections) or secure HTTP (for remote connections).  Yes, Red Carpet
can be used to manage systems remotely.  That's part of the reason why
it's so cool.

Security is handled by the Red Carpet Daemon.  Remote connections
will require a username and password, whereas local connections are
authorized by the kernel.  By default all local users have only viewing
privileges (except root, which has superuser privileges); remote users
have no privileges.


BUILDING AND DEVELOPING
-----------------------
Red Carpet is written in Python and C.  It requires

  * Python 2.2.2 or newer

  * pygtk 2.0.0 or newer

Red Carpet can only connect to rcd 1.4.1 or newer.

If you have the necessary requirements, building Red Carpet is easy.
It uses GNU autotools, so all you need to do is:

  % ./configure   (or ./autogen.sh, if you are building from CVS)
  % make
  % make install

We welcome contributors to Red Carpet.  Please see the HACKING file for
